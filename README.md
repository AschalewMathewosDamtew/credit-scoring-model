# Credit Scoring Model

## Overview
This project develops a Credit Scoring Model for Bati Bank, aimed at facilitating a buy-now-pay-later service in partnership with an eCommerce company. The model assesses the creditworthiness of potential borrowers using historical data to predict the likelihood of loan default.

## Objectives
1. Define a proxy variable to categorize users as high risk (bad) or low risk (good).
2. Identify observable features that correlate highly with the defined default variable.
3. Develop a model to estimate risk probability for new customers.
4. Create a model that assigns a credit score based on risk probability.
5. Predict the optimal loan amount and duration for new applicants.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.)

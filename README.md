# Task 1 - Understanding Credit Risk

This branch focuses on understanding the concept of credit risk, which is essential for effective financial decision-making and risk management in lending.

## Overview

Credit risk refers to the risk of loss due to a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. Understanding credit risk is crucial for financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and to mitigate potential losses.

## Key Components of Credit Risk

- **Credit Scoring**: Methods to evaluate borrower risk and assign scores based on credit history and other factors.
- **Risk Assessment**: Techniques used to measure and manage the risk associated with lending.
- **Default Probability**: The likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan.
